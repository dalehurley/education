## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**: Experience with Laravel/PHP (you've got this!)
2. **Time Investment**: Most chapters take 2-4 hours; AI Agent chapters (15-16) take 5-6 hours
3. **Practice**: Each chapter includes exercises and working examples
4. **Code Examples**: Check the `code-examples/` folder for reusable snippets

## üìö How to Use This Curriculum

1. **Sequential Learning**: Follow chapters in order for the best experience
2. **Laravel Comparisons**: Each chapter highlights Laravel equivalents
3. **Hands-On**: Type out the code examples, don't just read
4. **Exercises**: Complete the challenges at the end of each chapter
5. **Reference**: Advanced sections are for future reference

## üí° Tips for Laravel Developers

- **Don't fight the Pythonic way**: Some patterns differ from Laravel - embrace them
- **Type hints are your friend**: Similar to PHP 8+ typed properties
- **Async is built-in**: Unlike Laravel's queue system, async/await is native
- **Dependency injection**: FastAPI's Depends() is elegant and powerful
- **Documentation first**: FastAPI generates docs automatically from your code
