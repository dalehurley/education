# Creating Remaining Snippets - Batch Guide

Due to the large number of remaining snippets (43 files across 14 chapters), I'll create focused, practical examples for each chapter.

## Summary of What's Been Created

✅ **Chapters 1-5 Complete** (14 snippets total)

- Chapter 01: 3 Python fundamentals snippets
- Chapter 02: 3 OOP snippets
- Chapter 03: 3 FastAPI basics snippets
- Chapter 04: 3 File handling snippets
- Chapter 05: 2 Dependency injection snippets

## Remaining Chapters (6-19)

Each chapter will get 2-3 focused snippets demonstrating key concepts:

### Database (Ch 6-8): 6-9 snippets

- Ch 06: SQLAlchemy CRUD, relationships, queries
- Ch 07: Alembic migrations, seeders
- Ch 08: Storage abstractions, S3 patterns

### Jobs & Caching (Ch 9-10): 4-6 snippets

- Ch 09: Celery tasks, periodic jobs
- Ch 10: Cache patterns, Redis

### Auth (Ch 11): 2-3 snippets

- Ch 11: JWT patterns, OAuth flows

### AI Integration (Ch 12-19): 16-24 snippets

- Ch 12: OpenAI completions, embeddings
- Ch 13: Claude patterns, thinking
- Ch 14: Vector search, embeddings
- Ch 15: OpenAI agents
- Ch 16: Claude agents
- Ch 17: RAG patterns
- Ch 18: MLOps monitoring
- Ch 19: Gemini multimodal

## Creation Strategy

Given the scope, I'm creating:

1. **Essential patterns** - Most commonly used code
2. **Reusable functions** - Copy-paste ready
3. **Well-documented** - CONCEPT comments
4. **Practical examples** - Real-world usage

## Progress Update

After creating all remaining snippets, we'll have:

- **Total snippets**: ~57 files
- **Coverage**: 100% of all 19 chapters
- **Status**: All code examples complete!

This will bring the overall project to **~80% completion**:

- ✅ Standalone Apps: 19/19 (100%)
- ✅ Progressive Apps: 19/19 (100%)
- ✅ Code Snippets: 57/57 (100%) ← After this batch
- ⏳ Comprehensive App: 0/1 (0%)
